Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

### **Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arjunhg/pharma-quest.git
cd pharma-quest
```

### **Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### **Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NVIDIA_API_KEY=your-nvidia-api-key

ABLY_API_KEY='your-ably-api-key'

MONGODB_URL='your-mongodb-url'

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

RESEND_KEY='your-resend-api-key'
```

### **Running the Project**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.

## <a name="protein-data">🧬 Protein Data Processing</a>

This section covers the protein data processing pipeline, including loading protein structure files (e.g., PDB format), performing molecular docking simulations, and visualizing the results.

### **Protein Structure Input**

Users can upload PDB files for protein structures, which will then be processed by NVIDIA NeMo's protein-folding models.

### **Docking Simulation**

Using molecular docking algorithms, the system predicts how small molecules (such as drug candidates) bind to protein targets.
